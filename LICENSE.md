libav.js builds include correct license headers. Do not remove them.

If you make modifications to this repository beyond configuration changes¹ and
distribute builds with those changes, you are *legally obligated* to share those
changes. If you do not, you are in violation of FFmpeg's license terms. I'm
looking at you, “my startup is too cool to read licenses” scumbags.

¹ i.e., changes that link to FFmpeg.
